# ShackBrowse Privacy Policy

The ShackBrowse app is primarily a reader/posting app for ShackNews.com. It is an unofficial app and is not developed,
distributed or endorsed by ShackNews. This is a volunteer driven app and is open source.

You should review the ShackNews Privacy Policy first as ShackBrowse primarily reads and posts to ShackNews like any other browser
or app:

The ShackBrowse app itself will only store your Username and Password if you enter it for authentication. It will store this information
so it can authenticate and post as your user.

Firebase Crashlytics is integrated into the ShackBrowse application for basic crash and debug analytics usage. Firebase Analytics is integrated into the ShackBrowse application for basic analytics data like number of sessions worldwide, time spent in Android views, etc. No user identifying data is tied to the analytics, only the default configuration of Firebase Analytics is used.

Photos or videos posted through the Imgur functionality are open to the Internet and should be treated as such. See Imgur's Privacy Policy at:

Photos & Videos are not stored locally beyond default Android behaviour and is not transmitted to any other system. Imgur is the only active photo/video integration in the app.
